# Calculator
Creating a calculator in python, without using any inbuilt operators like +, -, %, /, * or comparisons (e.g. greater than, less than). Currently there is one use of a comparison which I am working to get rid of.

It is a single script, with no imports, in which methods are defined that can be used to perform the basic functions of a calculator - primarily, add(), subtract(), multiply(), divide() where each takes 2 arguments. Each argument and the result must be integers.
