# Calculator
Creating a calculator in python, without using any inbuilt operators like +, -, %, / or *, or bitwise logic.

Currently the calculator can add, subtract, multiply and divide two positive integers, where each number and the result are less than 255.

In time, I'd like to expand this to include negative numbers and decimals, and have a larger max integer value.
