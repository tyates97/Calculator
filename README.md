# Calculator
Creating a calculator in python, without using any inbuilt operators like +, -, %, / or *, or comparisons (e.g. greater than, less than). Currently there is one use of a comparison which I am working to get rid of.

It is a single script, with no imports, in which methods are defined that can be used to perform the basic functions of a calculator - primarily, add(), subtract(), multiply(), divide() for 2 arguments.

The calculator is able to add, subtract, multiply and any two integers, where each argument and the result are integers. The divide() function is limited to using only positive arguments, though this will soon be fixed.

In time include decimals and from there build more complex functions such as square_root().
